# Fast NCA

Fast implementation of the [Neighborhood Component Analysis](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2566-neighbourhood-components-analysis.pdf) algorithm in Python.

# Examples

sklearn-like API:

Sample usage:

```python
from nca import NCA
n = NCA()
n.fit(X, y)
X = n.transform(X)
```

Run the [example.py](example.py) file:

```bash
python example.py
```

# Installation

- NumPy
- SciPy
- Scikit-learn

If you want to use a virtual environment, just run the following commands:

```bash
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
